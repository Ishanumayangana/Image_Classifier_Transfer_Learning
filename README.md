# Image Classifier Using Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an image classifier using transfer learning. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models to accelerate the development process, improve accuracy, and reduce computational costs.

## What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed for a different but related task. It is used when datasets are small or training from scratch is computationally expensive.
